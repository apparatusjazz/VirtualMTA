# VirtualMTA

The VirtualMTA is a virtual reality project akin to a video game that seeks to simulate the experience of using the New York City Subway. The end goal is to help individuals with autism overcome the anxiety-inducing factors that come with riding the subway in real life. Virtual reality creates an immersive environment, both visually and audibly that can feel almost like stepping into a new world. Ideally, the project would simulate real-world conditions as closely as possible holding nothing back: the grimy feel of the stations, the sounds of the trains and conductors, crazy passengers, and of course train delays! Users would be able to explore a multitude of train stations and ride the train between stations.

The project was passed along from previous capstone students. The work they did includes a few functional subway stations, a ride-able train, train arrival time tracker, implementation of a heart beat monitor bar, control compatibility with the Oculus Rift, and some static train passengers. The proposed work to be done below is below in the proposed work plan.

Unity is the main software being used to build the VirtualMTA project. It is used along with visual studio to build C# scripts, the programming language which Unity uses.
